      Asanoha (麻の葉)
    </h2>
    <p class="pattern-intro">
      The Japanese name 麻の葉 (asa no ha) translates to hemp leaf. This pattern
      is used in other Asian cultures but I have yet to find alternate names.

  <p class="pattern-description">
    Six diamonds, each split in half in the longer direction, radiate from a
    central point. This forms the hemp leaf, which is repeated with overlap to
    create the pattern.
