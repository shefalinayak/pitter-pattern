The Japanese name for the pattern is _shippo tsunagi_, often abbreviated to _shippo_, meaning "the seven treasures" (a Buddhist concept). _Tsunagi_ means link or connection, relating to the infinite chain of linked circles which carry a meaning of peace and harmony. An alternate interpretation is that the diamonds represent sparkles, related to the jewels that are the seven treasures.
